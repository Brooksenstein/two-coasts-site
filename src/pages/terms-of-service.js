        &nbsp;will not be liable to you for any indirect, incidental,
        consequential, special, punitive or other similar damages, including but
        not limited to loss of revenues, lost profits, lost data or business
        interruption or other intangible losses (however such losses are
        qualified), arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms of
        Service or our Service itself, whether based on contract, tort or any
        other legal theory, and whether or not Two Coasts has been advised of
        the possibility of such damages. Two Coasts will not be liable to you
        for more than the amount you have paid to Two Coasts in accordance with
        these terms of service in the six (6) months immediately preceding the
        date on which you first assert a claim. You acknowledge and agree that
        if you have not paid anything to Two Coasts during such time period,
        your sole remedy (and Two Coasts’ exclusive liability) for any dispute
        with Two Coasts is to stop using our Service and to cancel your Account.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or
        the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages.
        Accordingly, some of the above disclaimers and limitations may not apply
        to you. To the extent that Two Coasts may not, as a matter of applicable
        law, disclaim any warranty or limit its liability as set forth herein,
        the scope of such warranty and the extent of Two Coasts’ liability will
        be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.

        In particular, nothing in these Terms of Service will affect the

        licensors, and partners harmless from any claims, losses, damages,
        liabilities, including legal fees and expenses, arising out of your use

        Service, or any breach of the representations, warranties, and covenants
        made by you herein. Two Coasts reserves the right, at your expense, to

        Coasts’ defense of these claims. Two Coasts will use reasonable efforts

    <p>
      <span>
        If a dispute arises between you and Two Coasts, we prefer amicable
        resolution to protracted legal battles. To that end, we have created a
        dispute resolution program we believe can resolve most matters. In order
        to avail yourself of our arbitration policy, you must first exhaust
        these steps to resolution:
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        1. CHECK THE FAQ: We recommend you start your resolution process by
        reviewing our “Help/FAQ” section for the applicable game you are
        playing. Each “FAQ” section is specific to each game. This section often
        addresses the most commonly asked questions or concerns players may
        have. Start here.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        2. IN-GAME HELP TICKET: If our FAQs did not resolve the issue, you may
        complete a help ticket in-game. Please state clearly your issue.
        Generally, a help agent will get back to you through the inbox message
        system in your account, and will work with you to resolve your issue.
        Please bear with us; we may need to research your issue to fully resolve
        the ticket, and this may require us to ask you further questions.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        3. ESCALATION: Although most issues can be resolved using our FAQs or
        in-game help ticket process, certain issues may require escalation, as
        reasonably determined by Two Coasts. In some cases, we may address the
        issue remotely. In others, we may ask to speak with you directly and
        will arrange a mutual time to discuss your matter. If you provide us
        with your phone number for this purpose, it will not be used for other
        purposes.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        In the event your issue remains unresolved after these steps, you may
        seek to resolve it through binding arbitration as follows:
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA, YOU AND TWO COASTS
        ALL AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS TERMS
        OF SERVICE, THE PRIVACY POLICY OR OUR SERVICE THAT CANNOT BE RESOLVED
        THROUGH OUR DISPUTE SYSTEM, WHICH HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED, THROUGH FINAL AND
        BINDING ARBITRATION. THIS APPLIES TO ALL KINDS OF CLAIMS UNDER ANY LEGAL
        THEORY, UNLESS THE CLAIM FITS IN ONE OF THE EXCEPTIONS IN THE EXCEPTIONS
        TO AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SUB-SECTION.
      </span>
      <span>&nbsp;</span>
      <span>
        IT ALSO APPLIES EVEN AFTER YOU STOPPED USING YOUR TWO COASTS ACCOUNT OR
        HAVE DELETED IT.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        An arbitration proceeding is before a neutral arbitrator instead of a
        judge and jury, so we both agree to give up our right to a trial before
        a judge and jury. Arbitrations have different rules than lawsuits in
        court. They are less formal than lawsuits in courts, and provide limited
        opportunity to force the other side to share information relevant to the
        dispute—a process called discovery. The arbitrator can award the same
        damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an
        individual. But, if any of us does not like the arbitrator’s decision,
        the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of
        arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        If we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be
        enforced or applies to our dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator
        will decide that, too.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        We all agree that we will go to court to resolve disputes relating to:
      </span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>
          Your or Two Coasts’ intellectual property (for example, trademarks,
          trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights or patents); or
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
          Any claim made in small claims court either in Los Angeles,
          California, or the county where you live, or some other place we both
          agree on, if it qualifies to be brought in that court.
        </span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <span>No Class Actions</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        We all agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an
        individual basis.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>That means:</span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>
          Neither you nor Two Coasts can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class
          member in a class action, consolidated action or representative
          action.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
          The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s claim into a
          single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or
          representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change
          this).
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
          The arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only
          impact the person who brought the claim, not other users of our
          Service, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users.
        </span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <span>Applicable Law</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        The Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions) is the
        law that will be applied to determine whether the dispute resolution
        provisions in this Section 9 regarding arbitration and class action can
        be enforced and how they should be interpreted.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        Apart from that, if you are United States resident, these Terms of
        Service and our relationship will be governed by California law, except
        for its conflicts of laws principles. If you reside outside of the
        United States, these Terms of Service and our relationship will be
        governed by English law, except for its conflicts of laws principles.

        to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of
        posting any bond or surety or proof of damages) in the event of any
        breach or anticipatory breach by you.

        You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable
