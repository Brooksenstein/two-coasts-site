      <span>Information We May Collect</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means
        personally identifiable information that specifically identifies you as
        an individual. We do not consider personal information to include
        information that has been de-identified, aggregated, or otherwise made
        anonymous so that it can no longer be used to identify a specific
        person, whether in combination with other information or otherwise.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        Two Coasts collects, processes and retains information about you from
        four (4) sources: (i) you (i.e., whenever you make personal information
        available to us); (ii) your devices (including web, mobile and wearable
        devices); (iii) cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies;
        and (iv) social networking sites and gaming partners. The types of
        information collected may vary depending on the type of activity you are
        engaged in and the information source.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        Personal Information you may voluntarily provide Two Coasts when you use
        our Services or register an account with us:
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        (i) your first and last name, (ii) screen/nick name, (iii) Two Coasts
        Services ID or third party service ID, (iv) email address, (v) phone
        number, (vi) photo or other image, (vii) DOB (month/year), (viii) sex,
        (ix) address, (x) friend connections, (xi) avatar image, (xii) credit
        card information, (xiii) shipping information; (xiv) friend’s name and
        contact information; and (xv) precise geo-location information.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        Here are some likely situations when you may make personal information
        available to Two Coasts:
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        (i) registering for our Services and any related contests and special
        events; (ii) accessing our Services using a third party ID, such as
        social networking sites or gaming services; (iii) subscribing to
        newsletters; (iv) purchasing a product or services through Two Coasts’
        online stores; (v) using “tell a friend,” “email this page,” or other
        similar features; (vi) requesting customer or technical support; (vii)

    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Two Coasts</span>
      <span>
        &nbsp;may use analytical software tools to automatically collect and use
        data that does not directly enable Two Coasts to identify you. There are
        two categories of data automatically collected by Two Coasts: “Website

        aggregated data as reasonably required by Two Coasts to enhance our
        Services and other Two Coasts related products.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        Please note that if you choose to disconnect a device or any Two Coasts
        game, we will no longer collect data from that device or game.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        We may on occasion match or combine the information automatically
        collected from your devices with personal information we obtain from you
        or other sources, including publicly available databases or third
        parties from whom we have purchased data, or that is already in our
        records. This sort of combined information may be used in the ways
        described in this Privacy Policy. This helps us to update, expand and
        analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide tailored
        products and advertising that may be of interest to you.

    <p>
      <span>
        We, and our partners acting on our behalf, use cookies, web beacons, and
        similar technologies such as JavaScript and e-tags to collect
        information about the pages you view, your movements around our
        websites, the links you click, and other actions you take on our
        Services. We also use this technology to gather demographic information
        about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports from our partners
        (e.g., Google Analytics) providing us with this collected information on
        an individual and aggregated basis based upon your use of our Services.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        You can control the use of certain cookies at the individual browser
        level. For more information on how you can block, delete, or disable
        similar technology, please review your browser or device settings. If
        you reject cookies, you may still use our website and our Services, but
        your ability to use some features or areas of our website and Services
        may be limited.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        We also use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand
        the functionality of our mobile software on your devices. This software
        may record information such as how often you use the application, the
        events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance
        data, and where the application was downloaded from.

      <span>
        Some of our Services may offer certain features and functions offered by
        social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn. These
        features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our
        website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function
        properly. Please note that these features are subject to the privacy
        policy associated with the third parties providing them.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        When you register to join or use our Services from a third party social
        networking site or gaming partner, certain personal user and/or
        membership information may be transferred automatically to Two Coasts.
        We may process, use, combine, disclose and retain such information in
        accordance with this Privacy Policy. This information may include, but
        is not limited to:
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>

        name and email address, basic profile information, or list of friends),
        and to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect

        use personal information only for the purposes for which the third party

      <span>Co-Branding</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        As part of our Services, Two Coasts may create co-branded webpages or
        games along with our third party partners and contractors. In connection
        with these relationships, Two Coasts may pass your personal information
        to these partners and developers in order to offer these co-branded
        games. Transfers to our partners and developers are covered by our
        Privacy Policy, our agreements with those partners and developers, and
        our co-branding partners’ and contractors’ privacy policies.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        Although different privacy policies may govern how your personal
        information is treated for co-branded games, we make reasonable
        commercial efforts to ensure that all of our third party partners and
        contractors adhere to the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy.
        Additionally, Two Coasts handles all customers’ inquiries (e.g., your
        customer services requests) and other forms of contact regarding our
        Services.

        You may choose to share information about yourself in the course of
        contributing user-generated content to our Services. Any information
        that you share in any of these forums, blogs, chats or the like is

        The security of your personal information is very important to us. Two
        Coasts follows generally accepted industry standards and maintains
        reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the security, integrity, and
        privacy of the information in Two Coasts’ possession. Some of the
        safeguards we use to prevent unauthorized on-line access to your
        personal information are firewalls and data encryption. Only those
        persons with a need to process your personal information in connection
        with the fulfillment of their tasks in accordance with the purposes of
        this Privacy Policy and for the purposes of performing technical
        maintenance have access to your personal information in Two Coasts’

        operating environments that are not available to the public. However, no
        system can be 100% secure and there is the possibility that despite Two
        Coasts’ reasonable efforts, there could be unauthorized access to your
        personal information. By using our Services, you assume this risk. If
        you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer
        secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you
        might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us
        of the problem through the contact information listed below.
